## Current Plan

### Phase 7: Courses and Education Carousel

1.  **Create the `Courses` component:** Generate the component files (`courses.ts`, `courses.html`, `courses.css`).
2.  **Define Course Data:** Set up the data structure for the courses in `courses.ts`.
3.  **Build the Carousel Layout:** Create the HTML structure for the carousel, including the track and cards.
4.  **Style the Carousel:** Add CSS for the layout, card design, and automatic scrolling animation.
5.  **Integrate the Component:** Add the `app-courses` selector to `app.component.html` and import the component in `app.component.ts`.
6.  **Update `blueprint.md`:** Document the new feature and the implementation steps.
7.  **Compile the project:** Run `ng build` to check for errors.
